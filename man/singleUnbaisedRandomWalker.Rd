\title{Implementation of voter model dynamics on a network in R.}
\usage{
singleUnbaisedRandomWalker(inputMatrix, L, initialNode = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputMatrix}{the input (ground-truth) graph with N nodes. Must be valid square adjacency matrix.}

\item{L}{the length of the desired time series.}

\item{initialNode}{starting node for walk}
}
\value{
results a list with TS matrix an N*L array of synthetic time series data.
}
\description{
Simulate voter-model-style dynamics on a network.
Nodes are randomly assigned a state in (-1,1) at each
time step all nodes asynchronously update by choosing their new
state uniformly from their neighbors.
Generates an N*L time series.
The results dictionary also stores the time series as TS and ground truth adjacency matrix as ground_truth.
